Hello, I'm Olav Fosse. 

I like programming, web development and tinkering with ~~Arch~~ ~~Emacs~~ OpenBSD.

- I mostly program in JavaScript/TypeScript, but have experience with Ruby, Lisp, POSIX shell, C/C++ and to a lesser degree Haskell and Python.
- Iâ€™m currently working on my personal projects [eradio](https://github.com/olav35/eradio/), [0x0](https://github.com/olav35/0x0) and [liracer](https://github.com/olav35/liracer).
- I'm studying GraphQL and TypeScript from part 8 and 9 of [FSO](https://fullstackopen.com/), learning different skills and technologies for my projects and occasionally reading in K&R.
