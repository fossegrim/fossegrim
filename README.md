Hello, I'm Olav Fosse. 

I like programming, web development, Emacs and OpenBSD.

- I mostly program in JavaScript/TypeScript, but have experience with Ruby, (Emacs) Lisp, POSIX shell, C, C++ and to a lesser degree Haskell and Python.
- Iâ€™m currently working on my personal projects [eradio](https://github.com/fossegrim/eradio/), [0x0](https://github.com/fossegrim/0x0) and [liracer](https://github.com/fossegrim/liracer).
